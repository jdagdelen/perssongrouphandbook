# Group Meeting <a name="group"></a>
There is a mandatory 1 hr group meeting that occurs approximately every two weeks. At group meeting, one of the group members will give a talk on their research. You will be placed on a rotating [schedule](https://sites.google.com/a/lbl.gov/perssongroup/group-meeting) that will have you present your work about every 1 year.

# Subgroup Meetings <a name="sub"></a>
Given our new additions and growth, we have decided to implement new subgroups, associated leaders, and members. Undergraduate students are welcome to join any subgroup they want, but be aware that subgroup meetings probably can't be moved around to fit undergraduate members' schedules.

The responsibility of subgroup leads is to find a slot where everyone can make bi-weekly meetings and send out calendar calls and reminders. The current subgroups are (leads are in bold):
