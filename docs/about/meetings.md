# Group Meeting <a name="group"></a>
There is a mandatory 1 hr group meeting that occurs approximately every two weeks. At group meeting, one of the group members will give a talk on their research. You will be placed on a rotating [schedule](https://sites.google.com/a/lbl.gov/perssongroup/group-meeting) that will have you present your work approximately once per year.
